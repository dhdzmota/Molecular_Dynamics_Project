# Molecular_Dynamics_Project

This repository contains a folder called Indene, in this folder, one can find three other directories:
FC, Python_scripts and Transitory files.

## FC

The FC directory contains all the files necesary to run the LAMMPS software, the most important files are the in.indene (which contains the instructions for the LAMMPS software that will yield the molecular dynamic) and also the indene_tridichlorobenzene.data file, which contains the positions of the particles.
The results of running LAMMPS are being saved in the Results folder.

## Python_Scripts

This directory contains 3 python scripts in jupyther notebook format.
The Coordiantes_over_time.ipynb contains information on the position of the particles in the dump files obtained by LAMMPS
The coordiantes_to_datafile.ipynb contains the code to obtain the information of Avogadro and include it into LAMMPS
Finally the Data_Visualization.ipynb contains the code to do a graphical analysis of the txt results of the molecular dynamics.

## Transitory_files

This directory contains the texts of the coordinates, the file generated by the python program of coordinates_to_datafile.ipynb programs, and also contains the avogadro files of the particles of the system.
